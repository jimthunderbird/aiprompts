please show me the html and javascript for the following html component:

[component details]
- the component will be a div with id number-list
- inside of the component:
  generate a list of 5 paragraphs
  each paragraph is one random number (range from 1 to 500)
  each paragraph should have a css class "number"
  when a paragraph is being dragged, do the following:
  - swap this paragraph with the paragraph it is over
  - emit an event "component_<component.id>_number_<number_index>_dragging"
  - the swapping should happen when the dragged paragraph is moving

[engineering guidance]
HTML Structure: Create the <div id="number-list"> container and dynamically generate five <p class="number"> elements within it using a loop in JavaScript.

Random Numbers: Use Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate random integers between 1 and 500 for the paragraph content.

Draggability: Set the draggable="true" attribute on all <p> elements.

Drag Handlers:

Attach dragstart to store the dragged element's reference and index.

Attach dragover to prevent default behavior and allow dropping.

Attach dragenter on target paragraphs to implement the swapping logic.

Swapping Logic (in dragenter):

Identify the target paragraph.

Check if the target is different from the dragged element.

Use DOM manipulation (insertBefore or replaceWith) to swap the positions of the dragged element and the target element immediately.

Keep track of the new indices.

Event Emission: Inside the swapping logic, use CustomEvent and dispatchEvent() on the component's parent or the window object to emit the specified event, including the component ID and the new index of the dragged number.

Cleanup: Attach dragend to remove any temporary visual styles or references.

[prompt output guidance]
do not add any css code
do not apply any inline style setting in javascript
this component should be independent, has its own scoping in javascript and css and do not intefere with other possible components in the same page
show me the html and javascript code only, no explanation and no extra words
do not show ```, ```html, ```javascript
do not include html tags like <html>, <head>, <meta>, only show me the related html and javascript codeblock
