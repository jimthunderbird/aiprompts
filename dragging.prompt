please show me the html and javascript for the following html component:

[component details]
- the component will be a div with id number-list
- inside of the component:
  make a div with id "status", with default text "moving status"
  generate a list of 8 paragraphs
  each paragraph is one random number (range from 1 to 1000)
  each paragraph should have a css class "number"
  when a paragraph is dragged and is moving over to another paragraph, do the following:
  - swap this paragraph with the paragraph it is over
  - when dragging started
    - emit an event "component_<component_id>_number_<number_index>_drag_started" 
    - update status to "drag started"
  - when dragging is on going
    - emit an event "component_<component_id>_number_<number_index>_drag_ongoing" 
  - when dragging is ended 
    - emit an event "component_<component_id>_number_<number_index>_drag_ended" 
    - update status to "drag ended"
  - when paragraph A is over paragraph B and if paragraph A's text is different from paragraph B's text
    - update status to "<paragraph_A_text> is over <pargraph_B_text>"

[engineering guidance]
use the following as guidance and experience:
- Create an empty div element with the ID "number-list".
- Start a self-executing anonymous JavaScript function.
- Inside the function, define a constant `componentId` as 'number-list'.
- Get the DOM element with that ID and store it in a constant named `container`.
- Initialize an empty array named `numbers`.
- Loop 6 times to generate random numbers.
- In the loop, generate a random integer between 1 and 500 using `Math.floor(Math.random() * 500) + 1` and push it to the `numbers` array.
- Iterate through the `numbers` array.
- For each number: create a new paragraph element (`p`).
- Set the paragraph's class name to 'number'.
- Set its text content to the current number.
- Set a data attribute `data-index` to the current loop index.
- Append the paragraph element to the `container`.
- Initialize `draggedElement` and `initialIndex` to `null`.
- Add a 'dragstart' event listener to the `container`.
- In the 'dragstart' handler, if the target has the class 'number', set `draggedElement` to the target, set `initialIndex` by parsing the target's `data-index`, and set the data transfer effect to 'move'.
- Add a 'dragover' event listener to the `container`.
- In the 'dragover' handler, prevent the default action and set the data transfer drop effect to 'move'.
- If a `draggedElement` exists and the target has the class 'number':
- Get the target element's bounding rectangle.
- Get the mouse cursor's vertical position (`e.clientY`).
- If `e.clientY` is less than the midpoint of the target element, insert the `draggedElement` before the target element.
- Otherwise, insert the `draggedElement` after the target element (using `targetElement.nextSibling`).
- After insertion, select all elements with class 'number' inside the container.
- Iterate over these elements and update their `data-index` attribute to their new index in the DOM.
- Add a 'dragend' event listener to the `container`.
- In the 'dragend' handler, if the target has the class 'number', reset the target's opacity and set `draggedElement` and `initialIndex` back to `null`.
- Select all paragraph elements with the class 'number' inside the container.
- Iterate over the selected paragraphs and set the `draggable` attribute to 'true' for each one.

[prompt output guidance]
make sure this component has its own scoping in javascript and css, do not intefere with other possible components in the same page
do not add any css code
do not apply any inline style setting in javascript
show me the html and javascript code only, no explanation and no extra words
do not show ```, ```html, ```javascript
do not include html tags like <html>, <head>, <meta>, only show me the related html and javascript codeblock
output the codeblock immediately
