please show me the html and javascript for the following html component:

[component details]
- the component will be a div with id number-list
- inside of the component:
  generate a list of 20 paragraphs
  each paragraph is one random number (range from 1 to 500)
  each paragraph should have a css class "number"
  when a paragraph is being dragged, do the following:
  - swap this paragraph with the paragraph it is over
  - emit an event "component_<component.id>_number_<number_index>_dragging"
  - the swapping should happen when the dragged paragraph is moving

[engineering guidance]
- This is a well-structured IIFE, a great pattern for keeping your initialization logic contained and clean.
- It begins by dynamically creating five random numbers (1-500) and generating the necessary paragraph elements within the `div#number-list`. You've correctly set the crucial `draggable="true"` and used `data-index` to manage state—excellent practice!
- The `dragstart` handler is straightforward, simply capturing the element and its initial index—a solid starting point for any drag operation.
- The `dragenter` listener is where the real ingenuity lies. It cleverly leverages `e.preventDefault()` to allow the drop target, and immediately performs the **DOM manipulation (swapping)** using `insertBefore()`. This creates a smooth "live sort" experience, which is far more engaging than swapping on `drop`.
- A critical step often missed is updating the indices. You've correctly **re-indexed all `data-index` attributes** after every swap to maintain accurate state for future drags—smart move.
- Finally, you're embracing modern development by emitting a **custom event**. This is the right way to decouple the UI component from the consuming application, providing a clean API for external logic to react to the sorting.
- Overall, this code is a robust demonstration of creating a dynamic, sortable component purely using vanilla JavaScript and the DOM API. Keep applying these patterns!

[prompt output guidance]
do not add any css code
do not apply any inline style setting in javascript
this component should be independent, has its own scoping in javascript and css and do not intefere with other possible components in the same page
show me the html and javascript code only, no explanation and no extra words
do not show ```, ```html, ```javascript
do not include html tags like <html>, <head>, <meta>, only show me the related html and javascript codeblock
output the codeblock immediately
