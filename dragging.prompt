please show me the html and javascript for the following html component:

[component details]
- make sure this component has its own scoping in javascript and css, do not intefere with other possible components in the same page
generate a list of 5 paragraphs
each paragraph is one random number (range from 1 to 500)
each paragraph should have a css class "number"
when a paragraph is being dragged, do the following:
- swap this paragraph with the paragraph it is over
- emit an event "component_<component.id>_number_<number_index>_dragging"
- the swapping should happen when the dragged paragraph is moving

[engineering guidance]
use the following as guidance and experience:
- Define the HTML structure: create a `div` element with the `id` set to `number-list`.
- Inside the `number-list` div, define a list of 5 paragraph elements (`<p>`).
- For each paragraph, set its `class` to `number`.
- Each paragraph should have its `draggable` attribute set to `true`.
- Each paragraph should contain a placeholder for the random number (e.g., `[Random Number]`).
- Optionally, for easy referencing in JavaScript, add a `data-index` attribute to each paragraph, starting from `0`.
- Create a `<style>` block scoped to the component (e.g., inside the `number-list` div or a separate file linked only for this component) to define the CSS for `.number` and any dragging-related styles, but as a quick scoping measure, prefix CSS classes with the component ID, e.g., `#number-list .number`.
- In the CSS, define a style for the `.number` class to give it a distinct appearance (e.g., border, padding).
- Define a CSS class for the element being dragged, e.g., `.dragging`, and apply a visual style (e.g., opacity) to it.
- Create a JavaScript function and immediately invoke it (an Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE) to create a private scope for the component's logic.
- Inside the IIFE, get a reference to the main component `div` using `document.getElementById('number-list')`.
- Define a function to generate a random integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- Get all paragraph elements with the class `number` inside the component.
- Iterate through the paragraphs and:
    - Generate a random number using the function.
    - Set the `textContent` of the paragraph to this number.
    - If a `data-index` attribute was added, ensure it corresponds to the paragraph's position in the list.
- Define a variable within the scope, e.g., `draggedElement`, to keep track of the paragraph currently being dragged.
- Add an event listener for the `dragstart` event to the component `div` (delegation) or directly to each paragraph.
- In the `dragstart` handler:
    - Store the event target (`this` or `event.target`) in the `draggedElement` variable.
    - Add the `.dragging` class to the `draggedElement`.
    - Set the `dataTransfer` property (e.g., `event.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', this.id)`), although not strictly necessary for in-place swapping.
- Add an event listener for the `dragend` event.
- In the `dragend` handler:
    - Remove the `.dragging` class from the `draggedElement`.
    - Set `draggedElement` to `null`.
- Add an event listener for the `dragover` event to the component `div` or to each paragraph.
- In the `dragover` handler:
    - Prevent the default behavior (`event.preventDefault()`) to allow dropping.
    - Identify the current paragraph the cursor is over, e.g., `targetElement = event.target.closest('.number')`.
    - Check if `targetElement` is a valid paragraph, is not the same as `draggedElement`, and `draggedElement` is defined.
    - If the conditions are met, perform the swapping logic:
        - Determine the direction of the drag relative to the target: if the drag is moving over the top half, insert before; if over the bottom half, insert after. A simpler way is to always insert before or after based on their current order in the DOM.
        - To swap, use `targetElement.parentNode.insertBefore(draggedElement, targetElement.nextSibling)` if moving after the target, or `targetElement.parentNode.insertBefore(draggedElement, targetElement)` if moving before the target.
        - After swapping, dispatch the custom event:
            - Create a new `CustomEvent` named `component_number-list_number_[number_index]_dragging`.
            - The `[number_index]` should be the `data-index` of the *dragged* element. You might need to re-evaluate the indices after swapping if you rely on them.
            - Dispatch the event using `document.dispatchEvent(event)`.
