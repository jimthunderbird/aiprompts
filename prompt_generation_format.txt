Each code generation prompt will have 3 parts:

[component details]
the component spec

[engineering guidance]
issue a prompt to super large LLM like chatgpt or gemini, for example:
"
i have the following spec:
please show me the html and javascript for the following html component:

[component details]
- make sure this component has its own scoping in javascript and css, do not intefere with other possible components in the same page
- the component will be a div with id number-list
- inside of the component:
  generate a list of 5 paragraphs
  each paragraph is one random number (range from 1 to 500)
  each paragraph should have a css class "number"
  when a paragraph is being dragged, do the following:
  - swap this paragraph with the paragraph it is over
  - emit an event "component_<component.id>_number_<number_index>_dragging"
  - the swapping should happen when the dragged paragraph is moving

please return me a plaintext code block with details step-by-step natural language instructions
on how to do that in detail html and javascript, use - in the beginning of each instruction

do not include any code, but show me instruction how to generate the code

no explanation and no extra words, return me just the plaintext code block

"

then capture the output of this prompt and use it as engineering guidance
