You are a PHP version 8.4.13 coding expert, please generate the php codeblock base on the <toml_spec>

- for all [component], only include their related html code, do not include html document tags like <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>...
- for all [component.<name>], if the datasource does not refer to a php logic, generate a php function named "component_<replace_dash_to_underscore_in_name>_datasource"
- for all [component.<name>], if it is an html component and there is no "id" attribute defined, make the html component id same as <name>
- for all [component.<name>], if the events like click,keypress...etc does not refer to a javascript logic, generate an anonymous javascript function for it
- for [logic.php.<name>], make the php function name same as <name>
  for example:
  [logic.php.hello_world] corresponds to a php function hello_world
- for [logic.js.<name>], make the javascription function name same as <name>
  for example:
  [logic.js.hello_world] corresponds to a javascript function hello_world
- do not use echo or heredoc to output html
- do not use inline css
- do not use inline javascript
- for all the css, make sure it works on both desktop web browser and mobile web browser
- do not include any mock testing code
- output the codeblock immediately, no explanation, no extra words
