you are a coding expert using python 3.11
please give me a python script and do the following:

- it will accept one cli argument <cli_arg>, validate the <cli_arg>
- save <cli_arg> to <toml_file>
- analyze the content of <toml_file>
  - if it has @include followed by a toml file path, read the content of included toml file and merge into the toml content <toml_content>
  for example, if we have
  @include a.toml
  @include b.toml
  we then need to read the content of a.toml and b.toml and merge them into <toml_content>
  when merging tomls, do a recursive merge so that, if two toml keys exists, replace the original one with the later included one
- print the <toml_content> 

output the python codeblock immediately, no explanation, no extra words
