show me the html/javascript codeblock base on the definition of an html component <html_component>

- output the codeblock immediately, no explanation and no extra words
- no css styles at all
- no inline javascript
- do not include html tags like <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, only show component related html
- put all javascript inside <script> tag
- use pure javascript
- do not output ```html and ```

also, please note that:
when we set up "local variable" or "data" for a component, it means we are setting up java variables binding to this component only, they will not interfere with other components

here is the <html_component>

# component html
<div id="numbers-list-demo">
  <p id="status">number drag and drop status...</p>
  <div id="numbers-list"></div>
  <button id="control-button">click on me</button>
</div>

# component data
- <counter>: starts with 1
- <numbers>: an array of 5 random numbers ranging from 1 to 1000, numbers will change on each page load

# component logic

#numbers-list-demo
- click inside of the component: 
  - append "click_inside" to .class
- click outside of the component: 
  - remove "click_inside" from .class

#numbers-list-demo > #numbers-list
- paragraph: for each <number>, <number_index> in <numbers>, <number_index> starts from 1 
  - class: "number"
  - odd:
    - class: "odd"
  - even
    - class: "even" 
  - id: p<number_index>
  - text: this is <number>
  - dragging start: 
    - set <paragraph with id "status">.text to "dragging number <number>"
    - append "dragging" to <current_paragraph>.class
  - dragging over:
    - insert <current_paragraph> before the paragraph under <current_paragraph>
  - dragging end:
    - set <paragraph with id "status">.text to "dropped number <number>"
    - remove "dragging" from <current_paragraph>.class
  - hover on: 
    - append "hover" to <current_paragraph>.class
  - hover off:
    - remove "hover" from <current_paragraph>.class
 
#numbers-list-demo > button#control-button
- text: click on me
- class: "control-button"
- mouse down:
  - append "click" to .class
  - pop up a message "you click on me <counter> times"
  - increment <counter> by 2
- mouse up:
  - remove "click" from .class
