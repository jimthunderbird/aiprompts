You are a PHP version 8.4.13 coding expert, please generate the php codeblock base on the following spec:

- read the content of tmp_spec.json and save it to <tmp_spec_json>
- store all logic.php.*, logic.js.* and component.* into its individual json file
  for example:
  for logic.php.abc, we will save the sub json into logic.php.abc.json
  for logic.js.abc, we will save the sub json into logic.js.abc.json
  for component.abc, we will save the sub json into component.abc.json
- output the codeblock immediately, no explanation, no extra words
